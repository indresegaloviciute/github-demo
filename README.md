# Github demo

There are instructions on how to set up and start using GitHub

## Installation and set up

You can use either GitHub Desktop or CLI.

If you want to use the Desktop version, it's good practice to be able to use CLI too.

If you haven't set up git locally, please follow [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git#setting-up-git).


## Tasks

Feel free to do both of these tasks, one or none.

1. With the existing (this) repo:
   - Create a new branch and let me know that you have been here 
   - Create a pull request, request anyone to approve it 
   - Merge pull request 
   - Release new version
2. Create a new repo
   - Add anyone to access repo as editor
   - Create a new branch
   - Add readme.md and actions:
     - One action for any branch 
     - One action for pull request
   - Create pull request, ask for approval and merge it


Cheat sheet for commands is [here](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf).
